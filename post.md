## Update, 2021-06-24

I'm a bit late this week. Our new baby is making things a bit more hectic than usual at home :-) Let's see how I did over the weekend. Here are the Round 15 results:

Broncos (17.7%), Rabbitohs (82.3%) &mdash; Rabbitohs won
Cowboys (46.2%), Sharks (53.8%)    &mdash; Sharks won
Panthers (68.5%), Roosters (31.5%) &mdash; Panthers won
Knights (50.0%), Warriors (50.0%)  &mdash; Knights won
Dragons (65.4%), Raiders (34.6%)   &mdash; Dragons won
Storm (91.4%), Tigers (8.6%)       &mdash; Storm won
Eels (94.4%), Bulldogs (5.6%)      &mdash; Eels won
Titans (46.4%), Sea Eagles (53.6%) &mdash; Sea Eagles won

100% success for the first time (if you generously count my 505/50 one as a success)! Matches I successfully predicted (in the sense of giving more than 50% probability to the actual winner): **8/8**
Probability I assigned to the true set of results: **0.0459** (note: I'm just using the above probabilities and independence which is actually an approximation) (compare to a person saying 50/50 for each match: **0.00391**).

Here are my probabilities for Round 16. The home team is listed first.

Roosters (27.4%), Storm (72.6%)
Warriors (56.4%), Dragons (43.6%)
Panthers (60.5%), Eels (39.5%)
Bulldogs (21.8%), Sea Eagles (78.2%)
Raiders (61.1%), Titans (38.9%)
Knights (61.8%), Cowboys (38.2%)
Broncos (39.7%), Sharks (60.3%)
Tigers (20.3%), Rabbitohs (79.7%)



## Update, 2021-06-15

Round 14 results. Penrith lost again, probably because of the State of Origin players. The lowly Bulldogs also had a rare win.

Sea Eagles (68.9%), Cowboys (31.1%) &mdash; Sea Eagles won
Sharks (19.3%), Panthers (80.7%)    &mdash; Sharks won
Titans (22.5%), Roosters (77.5%)    &mdash; Roosters won
Rabbitohs (87.0%), Knights (13.0%)  &mdash; Rabbitohs won
Raiders (59.1%), Broncos (40.9%)    &mdash; Raiders won
Warriors (13.6%), Storm (86.4%)     &mdash; Storm won
Eels (85.0%), Tigers (15.0%)        &mdash; Eels won
Bulldogs (24.9%), Dragons (75.1%)   &mdash; Bulldogs won

Matches I successfully predicted (in the sense of giving more than 50% probability to the actual winner): **6/8**

Probability I assigned to the true set of results: **0.00969** (note: I'm just using the above probabilities and independence which is actually an approximation) (compare to a person saying 50/50 for each match: **0.00391**).

Now, here are the probabilities for Round 15:

Broncos (17.7%), Rabbitohs (82.3%)
Cowboys (46.2%), Sharks (53.8%)
Panthers (68.5%), Roosters (31.5%)
Knights (50.0%), Warriors (50.0%) (!)
Dragons (65.4%), Raiders (34.6%)
Storm (91.4%), Tigers (8.6%)
Eels (94.4%), Bulldogs (5.6%)
Titans (46.4%), Sea Eagles (53.6%)

## Update, 2021-06-08

Round 13 results. This was a short round, because of State of Origin starting this week. Some big players were missing, and my inference doesn't account for this &mdash; Penrith's first loss of the season is the main apparent casualty.

Dragons (63.1%), Broncos (36.9%) &mdash; Dragons won
Tigers (15.1%), Panthers (84.9%) &mdash; Tigers won
Storm (93.5%), Titans (6.5%)     &mdash; Storm won
Knights (17.4%), Eels (82.6%)    &mdash; Eels won

Matches I successfully predicted (in the sense of giving more than 50% probability to the actual winner): **3/4**

Probability I assigned to the true set of results: **0.0736** (note: I'm just using the above probabilities and independence which is actually an approximation) (compare to a person saying 50/50 for each match: **0.0625**).

Now, here are the probabilities for Round 14:

Sea Eagles (68.9%), Cowboys (31.1%)
Sharks (19.3%), Panthers (80.7%)
Titans (22.5%), Roosters (77.5%)
Rabbitohs (87.0%), Knights (13.0%)
Raiders (59.1%), Broncos (40.9%)
Warriors (13.6%), Storm (86.4%)
Eels (85.0%), Tigers (15.0%)
Bulldogs (24.9%), Dragons (75.1%)

## Update, 2021-05-31

Round 12 results. Some matches that were close to 50/50 went the 'wrong'
way. I only got half of the winners right, but none of the other results were
too shocking.

Broncos (10.6%), Storm (89.4%) &mdash; **Storm won**
Cowboys (44.3%), Warriors (55.7%) &mdash; **Cowboys won**
Tigers (45.3%), Dragons (54.7%) &mdash; **Tigers won**
Panthers (95.60%), Bulldogs (4.40%) &mdash; **Panthers won**
Rabbitohs (44.2%), Eels (55.8%) &mdash; **Rabbitohs won**
Roosters (82.3%), Raiders (17.7%) &mdash; **Roosters won**
Sharks (53.2%), Titans (46.8%) &mdash; **Sharks won**
Knights (29.9%), Sea Eagles (70.1%) &mdash; **Knights won**

Matches I successfully predicted (in the sense of giving more than 50% probability to the actual winner): **4/8**

Probability I assigned to the true set of results: **0.00992** (note: I'm just using the above probabilities and independence which is actually an approximation) (compare to a person saying 50/50 for each match: **0.00391**).

Now, here are the probabilities for Round 13:

Dragons (63.1%), Broncos (36.9%)
Tigers (15.1%), Panthers (84.9%)
Storm (93.5%), Titans (6.5%)
Knights (17.4%), Eels (82.6%)


## Update, 2021-05-24

Warriors (64.8%), Tigers (35.2%) &mdash; **Warriors won**
Sharks (49.5%), Dragons (50.5%)  &mdash; **Sharks won**

Eels (84.5%), Sea Eagles (15.5%) &mdash; **Sea Eagles won**

Matches I successfully predicted (in the sense of giving more than 50% probability to the actual winner): **5/8**

Probability I assigned to the true set of results: **0.00143** (note: I'm just using the above probabilities and independence which is actually an approximation) (compare to a person saying 50/50 for each match: **0.00391**). D'oh! :)

The original post follows...

## Predicting NRL Matches in 2021
Growing up in the 1980s and 1990s in Western Sydney, one of the biggest events of the year was the Rugby League grand final. It really felt massive, even though I knew that the tournament was (back then) the NSWRL &mdash; New South Wales Rugby League &mdash; and thus was relatively parochial. I remember cheering on the Balmain Tigers against the Canberra Raiders in 1989, and then the Penrith Panthers agains the Raiders in 1990. The Raiders won both of those, but lost to the Panthers in 1991, seemingly due to the Panthers' change of jersey design from a boring white-on-brown to something resembling a licorice all-sort.

![Licorice all-sort](https://cdn.lbryplayer.xyz/api/v3/streams/free/i/b6b725e726f1372b718a902294255d185e488a64/6e2458)

Other associated memories which evoke a fond nostalgia are Tina Turner singing _Simply the Best_ (possibly with Jimmy Barnes, but I could be mistaken), and ads for Winfield cigarettes in the in-goal area.

In recent years, I've tried to get myself to care about Rugby League again, with little success. However, when an apparently exciting Panthers team made it to the 2020 grand final, I decided it would be good to follow them in 2021.

## Predicting Sports Matches

I have used sports prediction as an example in my Bayesian inference classes, available at lbry://@BrendonBrewer:3/stats331:5.

The assumptions I used there are known as a "Bradley-Terry model", but I didn't know that when I implemented it. I just did something I thought made sense.

Recently, I've updated those assumptions to make things a bit more sophisticated, and take into account winning margins and not just who was the winner of each match. Roughly, I'm trying to give each team an 'ability score', and infer the values of those from the results of all of the matches. To predict the future, I use those ability scores, but also take into account the fact that I don't know their values accurately (that's just what the sum rule of probability theory tells you to do).

## Publishing the Probabilities

The most annoying part of doing this sort of thing is getting the data. I'm doing manual data entry each week, which is how I'm tricking myself into caring about the NRL this year. It's working! I continually enter the results of new matches as they occur, and then use the accumulated data to predict the results for the upcoming round (weekend) of matches.

I had been publishing these on another platform, but I felt bad about that so decided to bring it to LBRY. Here are the probabilities for the upcoming round, Round 10 (I plan to update this each week). The first team listed in each matchup is the home team, and the probabilities are in parentheses.

Tigers (49.4%), Knights (50.6%)
Sea Eagles (64.1%), Broncos (35.9%)
Bulldogs (24.5%), Raiders (75.5%)
Sharks (18.5%), Rabbitohs (81.5%)
Roosters (88.7%), Cowboys (11.3%)
Warriors (20.8%), Eels (79.2%)
Storm (89.4%), Dragons (10.6%)
Titans (20.0%), Panthers (80.0%)

So far, my predictions have been working out pretty well, but I don't know whether they are any better than the strategy of just picking the team who is higher up on the ladder. Still, it's more theoretically satisfying to compute probabilities properly.
